# Production Environment Variables for Frontend

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_URL="https://your_deployed_backend_api.com/api"

# If your frontend needs direct Supabase access (e.g., for some specific auth client flows, though our current setup doesn't heavily rely on this for core logic)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"

# Add any other public environment variables needed by the Next.js app
