# Project Requirements: Application Tracker System

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Purpose
To build a modern, AI-powered job application tracker designed to help users efficiently manage their job search process. The system will enable users to track job applications, optimize their resumes against job descriptions using LLMs, and prepare for interviews with AI-generated questions.

### 1.2. Core Objectives
- **Track Applications:** Provide a centralized system for users to create, update, and monitor the status of their job applications across various companies.
- **AI-Powered Resume Analysis:** Offer tools to analyze resumes against specific job descriptions, providing actionable feedback, keyword suggestions, and a match score.
- **Interview Preparation:** Assist users in preparing for interviews by generating relevant questions based on their resume and target job descriptions.
- **User-Centric Design:** Deliver an intuitive and accessible user experience.

### 1.3. Target Audience
Job seekers, career changers, students, and professionals looking to streamline their job application process and improve their chances of success.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture:

```
+---------------------------+
|        Frontend           |
|  (Next.js + Tailwind CSS) |
|  (User Interface)         |
+-------------+-------------+
              |
              | (HTTPS - API Requests)
              v
+-------------+-------------+
|        Backend            |
|  (FastAPI + Python)       |
|  (Business Logic, LLM Integration) |
+-------------+-------------+
              |
              | (Database Calls, Service Integrations)
              v
+---------------------------+     +----------------------+     +---------------------+
|     Supabase              |     |   LLM Service        |     |   Qdrant            |

+---------------------------+     +----------------------+     +---------------------+
```

### 2.2. Components
