- **Password Reset (`/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`):** Forms for managing password recovery.

### f. User Profile/Settings (Optional, `/profile`)
- Manage account details.
- View application statistics.

## 4. Key Components
Reusable UI components will be developed, including but not limited to:

- **`JobCard.tsx`:** A card component to display summary information for a single job application (used on dashboard or list views).
- **`ResumeUploader.tsx`:** Handles file selection, drag-and-drop functionality, and upload progress for resumes.
- **`StatusBadge.tsx`:** A visual indicator (e.g., pill-shaped badge with color coding) to display the status of a job application.
- **`AnalysisReport.tsx`:** Displays the detailed results from the resume analysis.
- **`Navbar.tsx`:** Consistent navigation bar across the application.
- **`Modal.tsx`:** For confirmation dialogs, forms (e.g., adding/editing jobs).

## 5. Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (latest stable version, utilizing App Router).
- **Programming Language:** TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, potentially with a component library like HeadlessUI or Shadcn/UI.
- **State Management:** React Context API or Zustand.
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form for robust form validation and management.

- **File Upload:** A library like Dropzone.js or custom implementation for resume uploads.

## 6. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)

- **Intuitive Navigation:** Clear and predictable navigation patterns.
- **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines where possible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
- **Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, success/error messages).

## 7. Integrations
- **Backend API:** Seamless integration with all defined backend endpoints for data fetching and manipulation.
- **Supabase Auth:** Integration with Supabase for user authentication client-side (e.g., session management, social logins).

This document outlines the core frontend requirements. Specific design mockups, detailed component specifications, and user flow diagrams will be developed in conjunction with UI/UX design phases.
